A program in ARM assembly language that will compute all Perfect Numbers in the range 1 to 10000. 

A Perfect number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of it's proper divisors. For example, 6 is a perfect number. The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3 and 1+2+3=6. A proper divisor of n is any number that is a divisor of n other than n itself.
